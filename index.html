		<h2>Home</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my website. I'm a web development student from Fullerton, CA. I hope to advance my skills quickly so that I can get to work on your next profit-making website or app ASAP. Check out my <a href = "about.html">About Me</a> page to learn more about my background and interests.</p>
		<!--<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>I am a passionate language learner. I began learning human languages when I was a child. My favvorite human language to learn was German, which I studied for my BA. I have also learned a little Japanese, Classical Greek, Latin, and learned to read a little Spanish, French, and Italian. Eventually my passion for languages developed beyond human languages and I decided to learn computer languages. Computer languages proved to be a new exciting challenge for me that forced me to master syntax. While one can still be understood with syntax mistakes in human languages, I quickly learned how computer languages would challenge me by requiring me to apply perfect syntax.</p>

		<p>Besides human and computer languages, I'm also interested in history, spirituality, and theology. I completed a four-year study of the Bible, church history, and theology as a student in the Episcopal Church's Education for Ministry program. Completing Education for Ministry has enhanced my spirituality with new practices and helped me discern my vocations within lay ministry. I've also been employed as a teller at a credit union for over one year.</p>

		<p>If you have an idea for an app or website to help users learn a language, practice their spirituality, participate in your church remotely, or do their banking online? Keep checking in as I post updates on my web development journey. I'll be sure to let you know when I have the skills to make your ideas a reality.</p>-->
